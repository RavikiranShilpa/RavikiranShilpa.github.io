### Detect Non-negative Airline Tweets: BERT for Sentiment Analysis

<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project I am going to perform comprehensive EDA on the breast cancer dataset, then transform the data using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer.</div>
